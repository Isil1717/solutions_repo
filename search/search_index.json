While it may seem simple at first, it offers a rich framework to explore the relationships between velocity, angle, gravity, and trajectory. This task focuses on understanding how the range of a projectile depends on the angle of projection , while considering the influence of other variables such as initial velocity and gravitational acceleration. \ud83d\udcd0 1. Theoretical Foundation Equations of Motion A projectile launched at an angle \\( \\theta \\) with an initial velocity \\( v_0 \\) follows a curved path (parabola) due to the influence of gravity. The motion can be separated into two components: Horizontal motion (constant velocity) Vertical motion (uniform acceleration due to gravity) Velocity Components The initial velocity is split into horizontal and vertical components: \\[ v_{0x} = v_0 \\cos(\\theta), \\quad v_{0y} = v_0 \\sin(\\theta) \\] Time of Flight Assuming the projectile lands at the same vertical level it was launched: \\[ T = \\frac{2 v_0 \\sin(\\theta)}{g} \\] Range Formula The horizontal distance (range) the projectile travels before hitting the ground is: \\[ R = v_{0x} \\cdot T = v_0 \\cos(\\theta) \\cdot \\frac{2 v_0 \\sin(\\theta)}{g} = \\frac{v_0^2 \\sin(2\\theta)}{g} \\] Maximum range is achieved when: \\[ \\theta = 45^\\circ \\] This formula is valid only when the launch and landing heights are the same and air resistance is neglected. \ud83d\udcca 2.
