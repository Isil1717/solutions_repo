# Problem 1
# Investigating the Range as a Function of the Angle of Projection

## 1. Introduction
Projectile motion is a fundamental topic in physics that explores how an object moves under the influence of gravity. This document investigates how the **range** of a projectile depends on the angle of projection.

## 2. Theoretical Foundation

### 2.1 Governing Equations
The equations of motion for a projectile launched with initial velocity $$ v_0 $$ at an angle $$ \theta $$ are derived from Newtonian mechanics.

- **Horizontal Motion** (constant velocity):
  $$ x = v_0 \cos(\theta) t $$
- **Vertical Motion** (under constant acceleration):
  $$ y = v_0 \sin(\theta) t - \frac{1}{2} g t^2 $$

The **time of flight** $$ T $$ can be found by solving for when the projectile hits the ground ($$ y=0 $$):
$$
T = \frac{2 v_0 \sin(\theta)}{g}
$$

The **range** $$ R $$ (horizontal distance traveled) is given by:
$$
R = \frac{v_0^2 \sin(2\theta)}{g}
$$

## 3. Analysis of the Range
### 3.1 Dependence on Angle
- The function $$ R(\theta) = \frac{v_0^2 \sin(2\theta)}{g} $$ is maximized when $$ \sin(2\theta) = 1 $$, which occurs at $$ \theta = 45^\circ $$.
- Therefore, the maximum range is:
  $$
  R_{max} = \frac{v_0^2}{g}
  $$

### 3.2 Effects of Initial Velocity
Since range is proportional to $$ v_0^2 $$, increasing the launch speed increases the range quadratically.

### 3.3 Effects of Gravity
A higher gravitational acceleration $$ g $$ decreases the range, making projectile motion more constrained on planets with stronger gravity.

## 4. Practical Applications
- **Sports**: Understanding projectile motion helps in optimizing throwing angles in sports like basketball and soccer.
- **Engineering**: Used in ballistics and designing projectile trajectories.
- **Astronomy**: Understanding planetary motion and escape velocities.

## 5. Example Calculation

**Problem:** A projectile is launched at $$ v_0 = 20 $$ m/s with an angle of $$ \theta = 30^\circ $$. Find the range.

**Solution:**
$$
R = \frac{(20)^2 \sin(60^\circ)}{9.81}
$$
Using $$ \sin(60^\circ) \approx 0.866 $$:
$$
R \approx \frac{400 \times 0.866}{9.81} \approx 35.3 \text{ m}
$$

## 6. Python Simulation
Below is a Python script to visualize the range vs. angle of projection.

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

g = 9.81  # gravity (m/s^2)
v0 = 20   # initial velocity (m/s)

theta = np.linspace(0, 90, 100)  # angles from 0 to 90 degrees
range_values = (v0**2 * np.sin(2 * np.radians(theta))) / g

plt.plot(theta, range_values)
plt.xlabel('Angle (degrees)')
plt.ylabel('Range (m)')
plt.title('Projectile Range vs. Angle')
plt.grid()
plt.show()
```


This script generates a plot showing how range changes with the launch angle.

## 7. Conclusion
- The range follows a **parabolic** dependence on the launch angle.
- Maximum range occurs at **45Â°**.
- Computational simulations help in analyzing non-ideal cases with air resistance.

This document provides a foundational understanding of projectile motion, helping in both theoretical and practical applications.
